# AGENTS.md

Welcome! I am your AI coding agent. This file follows the [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/) standard to provide me with the context and instructions I need to work on the **Three.js Tutorial Dashboard (Next.js & Tailwind CSS)** project effectively.

## Project Overview
This project is an interactive 3D web development tutorial and dashboard built with **Next.js 15**, **Three.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It transforms a basic Three.js learning repository into a premium, modern web application where users can visualize 3D scenes and their corresponding source code side-by-side.

### Core Objectives
- **Modernizing the Stack**: Migrating from Create React App to Next.js 15 (App Router).
- **Interactive Learning**: Providing a "Split View" (3D Canvas + Live Code Viewer) for Five.js/Three.js concepts.
- **Visual Excellence**: Implementing a premium UI using Tailwind CSS v4 and shadcn/ui.
- **Three.js Education**: Organizing geometry, material, and advanced Three.js tutorials into a structured dashboard.

### Key Features
- **Modern UI/UX**: Focus on premium aesthetics and smooth micro-animations.
- **Performance Optimized**: Adhering to Vercel's engineering standards for zero-bloat and fast rendering.
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration across the entire codebase.

## Communication Rules
- **[No Emojis]** 사용자와의 모든 채팅 대화에서 이모지(Emoji) 및 이모티콘(Emoticon) 사용을 전면 금지합니다.
- **[Documentation-First Implementation]** If the USER requests a task or technical implementation that is not defined in the existing documentation, you must first clarify that it is outside the current scope and ask if the documentation should be updated before proceeding with the implementation. (문서에 정의되지 않은 작업을 수행하기 전, 반드시 문서 업데이트 여부를 먼저 확인하십시오.)

### Git
- Git commit messages must follow Conventional Commits in Korean
- Format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
- Example: `feat(ui): 버튼 컴포넌트 스타일 개선`

## Workflow & Safety
- **[Safe Checkpoint Strategy]** 새로운 작업이나 중요한 변경(새 파일 생성, DB 스키마 수정, 패키지 설치 등)을 시작하기 전에, 반드시 현재 상태를 git commit하거나 작업 디렉토리가 깨끗한지 확인을 요청해야 합니다.

## Testing Instructions
- Currently, tests are being integrated as part of the development phase (Phase 9).
- Run available tests using: `npm test`

## Documentation Standards

### Key Documents
- `docs/PLAN.md`: 프로젝트 기획서 및 비즈니스 모델
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`: 개발 구현 계획서 및 기술 아키텍처

### [Strict Document Hierarchy Rule]
To ensure the structural integrity and maintainability of the project, all documentation within the `docs/` directory must be strictly categorized into the following 7 core sub-directories (as defined in `DOCUMENT_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md`):

1. **`docs/core/`**: System-wide design foundations, DB schemas, and standard rules.
2. **`docs/features/`**: Detailed specifications of how individual features (billing, ai, chat, etc.) currently operate.
3. **`docs/roadmap/`**: Future implementation plans and strategic proposals.
4. **`docs/reports/`**: Historical verification reports and test results from previous phases.
5. **`docs/guides/`**: Practical guides and troubleshooting notes for developers and operators.
6. **`docs/stitch/`**: Detailed UI/UX designs and flowcharts for each screen.
7. **`docs/archive/`**: Legacy documentation retained for historical context only.

AI agents MUST respect this hierarchy when creating or modifying documents and proactively rebase misplaced files.

### [Document Prefix Numbering Rule]
When creating or naming documentation files, **prefix numbers must be attached** to indicate the chronological order in which documents were actually worked on. This prefix serves solely as a visual indicator of the sequence of documentation work. While the actual completion status of a document can be determined by dates recorded within the document itself, the prefix number is necessary for quickly identifying the order of document creation and should always be included when writing documentation.


## Development Standards & Critical Rules

### [CRITICAL: DATABASE INTEGRITY RULE]
You are strictly prohibited from performing any database operations, including migrations, schema resets, or structural changes, without first creating a complete data backup (dump). Data preservation is your absolute priority. Never execute destructive commands like 'DROP TABLE' or 'migrate reset' until a verifiable backup has been secured and confirmed.

### [MANDATORY BACKUP PROCEDURE]
Before initiating any database-related tasks, you must perform a full export of all existing records. This is a non-negotiable prerequisite for any migration or schema update. You must ensure that both user-generated content and administrative data are fully protected against loss before any changes are applied.

### [STRICT ADHERENCE TO STANDARDS]
Never suggest or implement "quick fixes," "short-cuts," or temporary workarounds. You must always prioritize formal, standardized, and industry-best-practice methodologies. All proposed solutions must be production-ready and architecturally sound, focusing on long-term stability and correctness over immediate speed.

### [NO TEMPORARY PATCHES]
You are strictly forbidden from proposing temporary bypasses or "quick-and-dirty" solutions. Every recommendation and implementation must follow the most formal and correct path. Prioritize robustness and adherence to professional engineering standards in every decision, ensuring that no technical debt is introduced for the sake of convenience.

### [Side-Effect Isolation]
When modifying shared components or logic, you MUST analyze the 'Impact Scope' first. Ensure that changes intended for a specific use case (e.g., AI features) do not inadvertently affect general functionality (e.g., normal chat). You MUST strictly isolate such logic using conditional checks or specific guards.

### [Strict Document Integrity Rule]
When updating or modifying any strategy, implementation, or design documents, you MUST strictly preserve the existing framework, formatting, and structural integrity. Do not perform total overwrites that discard previous detailed technical specifications, historical context, or complex logic. All updates must be made incrementally and appropriately integrated into the current structure to ensure no data loss or architectural context is sacrificed.

### [Strict Document Persistence Rule]
When updating or modifying any document, you MUST NOT overwrite, delete, or discard the existing content, historical context, or previous specifications. All updates must be made by appending new information or integrating changes incrementally while preserving the original framework. This ensures that the entirety of the project's evolution, including past technical decisions and verification records, remains fully traceable.

### [Standard Rules for Environment Variable Management]
1. **Strategic Isolation of Environments**
   - **Principle**: Maintain strict separation between Local and Production environments using file suffixes.
   - **Workflow**: Use `.env.development` or `.env.local` for local execution (test keys, localhost URLs). Use `.env.production` as the source of truth for deployment parameters.
   - **Priority**: AI must respect the framework's priority logic (typically: `.env.development`/`.env.local` overrides `.env`).

2. **Zero-Leak Security Policy (Git Integrity)**
   - **Rule**: No part of any `.env*` file shall ever be committed to a Version Control System (VCS).
   - **Verification**: AI must proactively audit `.gitignore` to ensure global patterns like `.env*` are effectively blocking all potential environment files before suggesting any variable updates.

3. **Cloud-Native Secret Management**
   - **Deployment Strategy**: Environment variables in production must be managed via the hosting provider's secure dashboard (e.g., Vercel, AWS) or CLI, never via file transmission to the server.
   - **Automation**: When syncing variables, prioritize using official CLIs to pull/push secrets between the local .env files and the cloud environment to prevent manual entry errors.

4. **Context-Aware Variable Configuration**
   - **Dynamic Mapping**: Redirection URLs, Auth providers, and Database connection strings must be dynamically configured to point to localhost in development and the verified production domain in deployment, managed through the isolated .env files.

### [React Performance Standards (Adapted from Vercel Engineering)]
All frontend development MUST strictly adhere to modern React engineering best practices.
**Primary Source of Truth: [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)**

**Architectural Reference:**
We adopt Vercel's high-performance principles (Anti-Waterfalls, Zero-Bloat) but verify implementation details against React Router patterns.
*For conceptual guidance, consult the local knowledge base at `.agent/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/`.*
*(Note: If the skill is missing, retrieve it from [SkillsCokac](https://skills.cokac.com/) or install via `npx skillscokac -i vercel-react-best-practices`. Always apply rules within the context of React Router v7.)*

1. **Eliminate Waterfalls**: Strictly prohibit sequential blocking data fetches. Always use `Promise.all` for parallel execution or leverage `Suspense` for streaming.
2. **Zero-Bundle-Bloat**: 
   - Mandate `React.lazy` (lazy loading) for heavy components.
   - Prohibition of "Barrel Files" (re-exporting index files) in ways that break tree-shaking.
3. **Server-Centric Optimizations**: Prioritize server-side data fetching (Loaders) and transformation to minimize client payload.
4. **Core Rules Enforcement**: 
   - Consult the rules in `.agent/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/rules/` for specific patterns (e.g., `rendering-content-visibility.md`, `js-early-exit.md`).
